End level transition:
Doesn't really make sensee for if you lose the level so we should have a sepaarate transition for if we lost a level
Like the paddles explodes or something


Make some level aliases so I can order them later on or something idk
Can use a grid or 2d array

Particles n shit:
	Upon loss the player paddle explodes

Menu screen:
	Numbered levels like in a flash game
	Little icon when you hover over to show what the level looks like plus level title
	
Custom cursor

Squash court:
Since we're always on the right hand side this should be on the right hand side as well

Cat level:
Every so often the cat stops animateing, targets the ball and launches towards it
It causes a rebound in the nearest angle or whatever and distrupts thing
the ball will also bounce against it as expected
