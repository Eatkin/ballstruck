Paddle basic:
It has collission
The ball will bounce off it
Paddle player:
It's the same but it can be moved
Can use bitmasks to determine properties

Hitting the right side of the paddle causes the ball to just not do anything so maybe I fucked something up with the rebound angle
Could it be, that I got something wrong?
No, it is the laws of trigonometry that are wrong
