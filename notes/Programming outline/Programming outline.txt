End level transition:
Doesn't really make sensee for if you lose the level so we should have a sepaarate transition for if we lost a level
Like the paddles explodes or something


Make some level aliases so I can order them later on or something idk
Can use a grid or 2d array

Particles n shit:
	Upon loss the player paddle explodes

Menu screen:
	Numbered levels like in a flash game
	Little icon when you hover over to show what the level looks like plus level title
	
Custom cursor


Ball can phase through paddles (particularly in speedball)
I need to change the main logic so that it loops always

No Intelligence:
If either wall is hit you lose
The scoreboard is replaced with a countdown for 10 seconds
Also should include acceleration property for the ball
