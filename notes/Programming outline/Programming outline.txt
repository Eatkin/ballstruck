Let's think about programming our first level
The level manager needs to determine some things:
	- Title
	- Countdown for level starting
	- Scoring
	- Win conditions
	
Make the level title object
It shows a Thicc text with outline (use a shader)
It rotates back and forth

Oh let's also think about cool effects
Because the level is very simple, I can draw a gradient, a black background over the top, then use bm_subtract to draw the paddle and ball to cut out the background
