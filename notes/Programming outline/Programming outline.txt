End level transition:
Doesn't really make sensee for if you lose the level so we should have a sepaarate transition for if we lost a level
Like the paddles explodes or something


Make some level aliases so I can order them later on or something idk
Can use a grid or 2d array

Particles n shit:
	Paddles and balls should ease in
	So should the title
	And score board
	Scoreboard text should shake or zoom or something whenever a point is scored
	It should also throw out little number particles
