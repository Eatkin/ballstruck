Rebound angle is WRONG!
Sort of
It works for debounding off the left of a paddle, but not for the right
probably because I'm a retard who can't do trigonometry

Let's think about programming our first level
The level manager needs to determine some things:
	- Title
	- Countdown for level starting
	- Scoring
	- Win conditions
	
Make the level title object
It shows a Thicc text with outline (use a shader)
It rotates back and forth

Some stuff:
	Score counters
	End level transitions properly
	Some cool ass screen shake
	Some sort of reset for the ball instead of just contuing eg in with gravitas
	The with gravitas AI is hopeless, needs tweaking a bit more
	
Cool colours isn't working properly
Also I think the surface is slightly off
