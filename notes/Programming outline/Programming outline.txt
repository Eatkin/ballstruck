Some stuff:
	End level transitions properly
	
End of level
Make the ball explode into particles or something
Add destroy events to the ball and the paddles for some particles n shit
Also determine whether to blow up opponent or player paddle
Need logic to determine whether we go to next level or restart the room on level end

Transition looks shit

Need a transition in too, can just be a fade. Or maybe it'll be fine. Idk.
