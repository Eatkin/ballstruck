End level transition:
Doesn't really make sensee for if you lose the level so we should have a sepaarate transition for if we lost a level
Like the paddles explodes or something


Make some level aliases so I can order them later on or something idk
Can use a grid or 2d array

Particles n shit:
	Upon loss the player paddle explodes

Menu screen:
	Numbered levels like in a flash game
	Little icon when you hover over to show what the level looks like plus level title
	
Custom cursor

Pong Volleyball:
Blocks should have eyes drawn on them that follow the ball
	This requires an additional sstep to the rendering which will render things ontop of the cutaway
Opponent paddle needs to be not retarded and be able to jump and it also needs physics setting up in the same way as the player physics
Scoring is wrong, should happen when ball hits the ground not when ball hits the edges
We also need to have an alternative scoreboard so it looks like slime volleyball


Ball can phase through paddles (particularly in speedball)
I need to change the main logic so that it loops always
